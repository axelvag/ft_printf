# ft_printf

The ft_printf project is an exercise that aims to teach how to implement the printf function in C language. The printf function is a C standard library function used to format and display data to standard output.

Here is a general presentation of the ft_printf project:

Project Name: ft_printf

Objective: Implement a simplified version of the printf function in C.

Main Steps:

  Format String Parsing: Like printf, the function must be able to parse the supplied format string, identifying conversion specifiers such as %d, %s, %c, etc.

  Argument Handling: The function must support a variable number of arguments, depending on the conversion specifiers. It must correctly extract the arguments and display them according to the format specifications.

  Formatting: The function must format the data according to the conversion specifiers. For example, %d for integers, %s for strings, etc.

  Return: The function should return the total number of characters written, like printf does.

Constraints:

  The function must be defined in a file called ft_printf.c.
  It is not allowed to use the printf function from the standard library.
  Conversion handlers should be correctly implemented for different specifications (like %d, %s, %c, %p, etc.).

This project is designed to develop in-depth understanding of format specifiers, variable argument handling, and advanced memory management concepts in the C language. It is often considered an excellent exercise for strengthening programming and manipulation skills. of character strings in C.
